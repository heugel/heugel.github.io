In 2015 and 2016, I worked for a now-defunct indie game company.  My primary job was audio work (music, sound effects, etc.), but through that company I also learned how to make games using [Unity](https://unity.com/) and the programming language C#.  I'll talk briefly here about a few of my solo projects, as well as some projects I've helped students make:

## Franiel
This was my very first completely solo project, and I used it as a learning experience.  I cared more about learning how to animate and code than having a good-looking finished product, so I just hastily drew all of the assets in [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/).  The goal was to complete enough of the randomly generated quests to earn enough money to upgrade your character enough to fight the 2 bosses--the sky boss and the underground boss.

My second project (not completely solo this time, since a couple friends helped me with the art) started because I had no spring break plans in 2017, so I decided to make something awful.  I just wanted to make the absolute worst version of Pokemon possible.  Weird creature designs, unfair moves, unpredictable type match-ups, and pickpockets that randomly steal all your money all make appearances.  I decided on a new artistic direction for this game--I edited together stock images instead of drawing my assets.  Through this project, I fell in love with this style.  I find it both hilarious and fun to make.

## frog
I've been working on this one on-and-off since late 2017 and I'm not even anywhere close to being done.  It's my first story-driven game, and by far my most ambitious.  There are so many weapons, items, and NPCs, and it's also a semi-open-world game.  This project has been taking so long because I'm not much of a writer, so I take long breaks to think about the direction of the story.  I'm also very limited in my map-making tools, since I decided to stick to the silly stock image style.
