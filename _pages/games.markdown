In 2015 and 2016, I worked for a now-defunct indie game company.  My primary job was audio work (music, sound effects, etc.), but through that company I also learned how to make games using [Unity](https://unity.com/) and the programming language C#.  I'll talk briefly here about a few of my solo projects, as well as some projects I've helped students make:

## Franiel
This was my very first completely solo project, and I used it as a learning experience.  I cared more about learning how to animate and code than having a good-looking finished product, so I just hastily drew all of the assets in [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/).  The goal was to complete enough of the randomly generated quests to earn enough money to upgrade your character enough to fight the 2 bosses--the sky boss and the underground boss.

## m0nst3rz
My second project (not completely solo this time, since a couple friends helped me with the art) started because I had no spring break plans in 2017, so I decided to make something awful.  I just wanted to make the absolute worst version of Pokemon possible.  Weird creature designs, unfair moves, unpredictable type match-ups, and pickpockets that randomly steal all your money all make appearances.  I decided on a new artistic direction for this game--I edited together stock images instead of drawing my assets.  Through this project, I fell in love with this style.  I find it both hilarious and fun to make.

I recently revisted this project to implement multiplayer battling and trading and to upload to the Google Play Store, so feel free to download it and battle your friends :)

## frog
I've been working on this one on-and-off since late 2017 and I'm not even anywhere close to being done.  It's my first story-driven game, and by far my most ambitious.  There are so many weapons, items, and NPCs, and it's also a semi-open-world game.  This project has been taking so long because I'm not much of a writer, so I take long breaks to think about the direction of the story.  I'm also very limited in my map-making tools, since I decided to stick to the silly stock image style.

## Paintball Gladiator
Paintball Gladiator is a game I made in collaboration with a student who is interested in game design.  It's a fairly difficult first-person game where you defeat monsters in the Roman Colosseum with a paintball gun.  It's also available for free on the Google Play Store!  Maybe you should check it out :)

## Sky High Driving
This driving game was another collaboration project with the same student mentioned above.  The goal here is to not fall off the procedurally generated track for as long as you can.  This one is also available for free on the Google Play Store, and we worked hard to include an online leaderboard.  So try it out, please--I hope to see some new names on the high scores list :)
